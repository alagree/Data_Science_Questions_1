**Data Science Course Assignments**

Welcome to my Data Science Assignments repository! This repository contains a collection of questions, code samples, and answers from data science courses. These questions cover various topics and challenges related to data analysis, data manipulation, and problem-solving.

**Repository Contents**

This repository is organized into multiple sections, each corresponding to a different assignment or topic. Here's an overview of the contents:

**Question 1: DNA Symbol Counter**
In this question, we count the occurrences of symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in a given DNA string. The code provided here demonstrates how to analyze and visualize DNA sequences, which can be useful in bioinformatics and genetics research.

**Question 2: State Capital Search**
This question involves finding capital city names that contain the name of a state as a substring. It showcases a practical use case of dictionaries and string manipulation to extract meaningful information from data.

**Question 3: Point Rectangle Check**
The isIn() function checks if a point lies within or on the edge of a specified rectangle. It is a valuable utility function for spatial data analysis and geometric problem-solving.

**Question 4: Points in Rectangle Check**
Building upon the previous question, the allIn() function determines whether a list of points are all within or on the edge of a given rectangle. This can be helpful in scenarios where you need to validate multiple data points against a predefined region.
