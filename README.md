Explore these intriguing Questions that will take you on a journey through Python coding and problem-solving! 🌟💡 Here's what you'll find:

### Question #1: Count Symbols 🧬

In this question, you are given a DNA string represented by symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. Your task is to write code that counts the number of times each of these symbols occurs in the string and prints the counts.

### Question #2: Find a Substring 🔎

Given a dictionary of US states and their capitals, write code to find and print a list of capitals that contain the name of a state as a substring.

### Question #3: Is a Data Point Within a Rectangle? 📐

Write a function, `isIn()`, which returns `True` if a point is within a rectangle specified by two sets of coordinates, and `False` if the point is outside the rectangle. The function accepts three parameters: the coordinates of the rectangle's corners and the point being tested.

### Question #4: Are All Points Within a Rectangle? 📐

Modify the previous function, `allIn()`, to accept a list of points and return `True` only if all points in the list are within or on the edge of the rectangle.
